These classes contain code that was ported from a JavaScript project
by [Kevin Lindsey](http://www.kevlindev.com/).

Kevin's original code is licensed under a BSD-3-clause license.

We have reached a gentlemen's agreement to dual-license the ported code (thanks Kevin!).

This way, we can include the code in the freesewing project under a GPL license, 
yet it remains available under the original BSD-3-clause license for those who prefer that option.

The GPL licensed code is part of freesewing's [core](https://github.com/freesewing/core) repository.
